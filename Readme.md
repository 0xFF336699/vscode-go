# Go for Visual Studio Code

This Code extension adds rich language support for the Go language, including:

- Colorization
- Completions Lists (using `gocode`)
- Snippets
- Quick Info (using `godef`)
- Goto Definition (using `godef`)
- Find References (using `go-find-references`)
- Rename (using `gorename`)
- Build-on-save (using `go build` and `go test`)
- Format (using `goreturns` or `goimports` or `gofmt`)
- [partially implemented] Debugging (using `delve`)

## Using

First, you will need to install a dogfood build of Visual Studio Code, for example build [2945a564](https://monacotools.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/_git/Monaco/commit/2945a564bb3c116665cc80f24ad176df255adbc0) for [Mac](https://ticino.blob.core.windows.net/build/2945a564bb3c116665cc80f24ad176df255adbc0/VSCode-darwin.zip?st=2015-09-21T21%3A32%3A43Z&se=2015-09-21T23%3A37%3A43Z&sp=r&sv=2014-02-14&sr=b&sig=tX090NW5sxOptKQDJ%2FMny%2BweVban3chLZUaw4t8eCCw%3D), [Linux (x64)](https://ticino.blob.core.windows.net/build/2945a564bb3c116665cc80f24ad176df255adbc0/VSCode-linux-x64.zip?st=2015-09-21T21%3A32%3A43Z&se=2015-09-21T23%3A37%3A43Z&sp=r&sv=2014-02-14&sr=b&sig=CwfkOdf%2FJKJbTjpMmJyF93djfN%2F16fFx5cs0B5E51%2FA%3D), [Windows](https://ticino.blob.core.windows.net/build/2945a564bb3c116665cc80f24ad176df255adbc0/VSCodeSetup.exe?st=2015-09-21T21%3A32%3A43Z&se=2015-09-21T23%3A37%3A43Z&sp=r&sv=2014-02-14&sr=b&sig=pkxQMStGayThmgSW4SHsg9DdGyTQ6bpHQl1EeQU2wxs%3D).

__Note__: Once youâ€™ve installed this, do not accept any automatic updates.  If you do, you will be reverted to publicly released builds.  If you find the popups annoying, you can disable automatic update.

Next, clone this repo into your Code extensions folder and run `npm install`.

```bash
cd ~/.vscode/extensions/
git clone https://monacotools.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Monaco/_git/go-code
cd go-code
npm install
```

In a terminal window with the GOPATH environment variable set to the GOPATH you want to work on, launch `code`.  Open you GOPATH folder or any subfolder you want to work on, then open a `.go` file to start editing.

### _Optional_: Debugging

To use the debugger, you must currently manually install `delve`.  See the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/derekparker/delve/wiki/Building) for full details.  This is not support right now on Windows, and on OS X it requires creatinga  self-signed cert to sign the `dlv` binary with.

Once this is installed, go to the Code debug viewlet and select the configuration gear, placing the following in your launch.json:

```json
{
	"version": "0.1.0",
	"configurations": [
		{
			"name": "Delve test",
			"type": "go",
			"program": "/Users/lukeh/dd/go/src/github.com/lukehoban/azuretest/test.go"
		}
	]
}
```

## Building & Running

You can set up a development environment for debugging the extension uring extension development.

First make sure you do not have the extension installed in `~/.vscode/extensions`.  Then clone the repo somewhere else on your machine, and run `npm install` and open a development instance of Code.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.vscode/extensions/go-code
cd ~
https://monacotools.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Monaco/_git/go-code
cd go-code
npm install
code . 
```

To build, use the `Tasks: Run Build Task` command (cmd-shift-B).

To debug, go to the Debug viewlet and select `Launch Extension` then hit play (F5).

In the `[Extension Development Host]` instance, open your GOPATH folder, then close and re-run the `Launch Extension` debug target to attach to launch and attach to an instance of Code opened to your GOAPTH.

You can now hit breakpoints and step through the extension.

## Tools

The extension uses the following tools, installed in the current GOPATH.  If any tools are missing, the extension will offer to install them for you.

- gorename: `go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gorename`
- gocode: `go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode`
- goreturns: `go get -u sourcegraph.com/sqs/goreturns`
- godef: `go get -v github.com/rogpeppe/godef`
- golint: `go get -u github.com/golang/lint/golint`
- go-find-references: `go get -v github.com/redefiance/go-find-references`
